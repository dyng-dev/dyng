## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: Apache-2.0 license, NOTICE, CITATION.cff, AUTHORS, governance and
  contribution guides, ADRs 0001 (name), 0002 (license and credit), 0004 (naming) and 0014
  (approval checkpoints).
- Project infrastructure (M4): SECURITY.md with the disclosure process, SUPPORT.md,
  MAINTAINERS.md, a complete CONTRIBUTING.md, eight GitHub issue forms and the issue chooser,
  the pull request template with the review checklist, CODEOWNERS, the DCO app configuration,
  the label taxonomy (`.github/labels.yml`, applied by the `labels` workflow;
  `docs/developer/labels.md`), `ci/github_meta_check.py` (a pre-commit hook),
  `.readthedocs.yaml` (not connected yet) and the repository settings guide
  (`docs/developer/repository_settings.md`).
- Documentation site (M4): Sphinx + MyST + pydata-sphinx-theme + Breathe over the Doxygen XML,
  in the Diataxis sections (getting started, tutorials, how-to guides, explanation including
  the update model, reference with the curated C++ API and file formats, developer pages with
  the ADRs, retrospectives and the parity guide); a landing page, "How to cite" from
  `docs/references.bib`, the public roadmap (`docs/roadmap.md`) and the short plan
  (`docs/developer/plan.md`). `ci/docs.sh` builds it with warnings as errors and checks internal
  links (`--doxygen-only` for the Doxygen check alone); the `docs` workflow builds it on hosted
  runners from `environment.yml` (which now pins the Sphinx tools) and uploads the site.
- Workflow hardening (M4): every `actions/checkout` sets `persist-credentials: false`,
  `release.yml` passes step outputs to its scripts through `env:`, dependabot waits 7 days
  before proposing a new action release; pre-commit runs `actionlint` (with shellcheck) and
  `zizmor` on the workflows, and `ci/github_meta_check.py` enforces the least-privilege and
  SHA-pinning rules (`--verify-pins` checks each SHA against its version tag).
- Build system: CMake >= 3.30 with presets `dev`, `release`, `relwithdebinfo`, `cpu-only`,
  `asan`, `tsan` and `parity`; the `dyng-dev` conda environment (`environment.yml`) and
  `scripts/dev_env.sh`; install and export of `dyng::dyng` for `find_package(dyng)`.
- Core: error hierarchy with `DYNG_EXPECTS` / `DYNG_FAIL`; backends and `resources`
  (sequential, OpenMP with a thread count); `stream_ref`; `memory_resource_ref` and the host
  memory resource; `array_view`; `buffer`; host copies; logging with a replaceable sink; an
  instance-based profiler with `<algo>.<hook>` stage names; `citation()`.
- Quality: GoogleTest unit tests with CTest labels, the header self-containment check,
  `ci/check.sh`, the Doxygen check, pre-commit (clang-format, REUSE, codespell), and the
  `lint` and `cpu` GitHub workflows.
- Graph: `graph<V,E,W>` (pimpl, host storage, compact rows, objective-major weight columns,
  stored in-edges, version counter), `graph_view`, `csr` / `csr_view`, `edge_list` /
  `edge_list_view`, `edge_batch` / `edge_batch_view`, `apply_summary`, `graph_properties`
  with `row_order`, `multi_edges`, `batch_semantics` and the preset `mosp_compatible()`;
  `graph::apply` is MOSP's `applyChangeBatch()` ported straight (ADR 0010).
- I/O: Matrix Market reader and writer (seeded random weights bit-exact with `mospPrep
  mtx2csr`), the MOSP text CSR, `insert.txt` / `delete.txt` batches, distance and SSSP-tree
  files; strict parsing with `io_error` carrying path, line and column
  (`docs/api/file_formats.md`).
- Byte-parity fixtures for the updated CSR, its transposition and the weight-increase flags
  against MOSP-OpenMP@c352151 (`parity/fixtures/graph_io/`).
- `sssp`: `compute()` and `update()` on the sequential backend (MOSP's `sequentialSOSPUpdate`
  adapted into hooks) and the OpenMP backend (MOSP-OpenMP's `sospUpdateCpu` /
  `sospFromScratchCpu` ported straight); canonical trees identical across backends and
  byte-identical to MOSP-OpenMP@c352151 on the test corpus; `result::from_arrays` with
  canonicalization and `validate_inputs`; `stale_result_error` detection
  (`docs/algorithms/sssp.md`, ADR 0006).
- `update_stats`, and `dyng::update(res, g, batch, results...)` / `dyng::update_each()` to apply a
  batch once for several results.
- `dyng::testing` (installed target): `dijkstra()` with lowest-id ties and `check_sssp_tree()`.
- `tools/compat/dyng-compat-mosp` (drop-in clone of the per-objective part of MOSP's `mosp`
  driver and of `mospPrep init`), the `sssp_update` example, `parity/timed_regions/sssp.toml`
  and the sssp byte-parity fixtures (`parity/fixtures/sssp/`).
- The parity harness (`parity/`, ADR 0013): `references.toml` (MOSP-OpenMP c352151, MOSP-CUDA
  e220ee2 and their baseline SHAs), `build_reference.sh` (verified `git archive` scratch copies,
  unpatched and patched, archive-build check), additive export tools, `export_goldens.py` (the
  sssp golden corpus, now 495 cases, with the originals cross-checked, reproducible export),
  `goldens.toml`, `compare.py` (CTest label `parity`), `perf_ab.py` (A/B/A/B under the perf
  lock), and the M1a parity certificate `parity/results/M1a.md`.
- `dyng-compat-mosp --write-graph` writes the updated graph in MOSP's CSR text format.
- A pure-Python name-reservation package `dyng` 0.0.1 (`tools/name_reservation/`) and the
  Trusted Publishing workflow `release.yml`.
- `ci/check.sh --parity` (the golden replay as part of the local gate) and a clang-tidy step
  with the naming rules of ADR 0004; `ci/doxygen_coverage.py` (a `@brief` on every public
  entity, every entity in a group, `@backends` / `@determinism` / `@paper` on `compute` and
  `update`) run by `ci/docs.sh`, also as the CMake target `docs-doxygen`.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 3.0), `SECURITY.md` and `SUPPORT.md`.
- The M1a retrospective with the acceptance record and a re-estimate of the roadmap
  (`docs/developer/retrospectives/M1a.md`).

- `legacy_batch_options::mosp_lenient` (MOSP's accept/reject rules for batch files; used by
  `dyng-compat-mosp`), `sssp::stats::packed_parents` on both CPU backends, and the golden group
  `noncanonical` (107 cases with perturbed tie parents; 495 golden cases in total).
- `ci/provenance_check.py` (provenance headers of ported files), ruff lint and format for the
  Python harness, smoke tests of the harness (`parity/tests`), Clang 17/18 jobs in `cpu.yml`.

### Changed

- The host transposition runs in parallel on the OpenMP backend (same, deterministic result).
- `io::read_csr_triplet` reads its three files concurrently (same result and the same first
  error as reading them one after the other); `dyng-compat-mosp` reads and writes its files
  concurrently, like the original driver. dynG now links `Threads::Threads` privately.
- `sssp`: the sequential backend uses the tie rule of `sospUpdateCpu` (an improved vertex offers
  its (distance, id) pair) instead of the re-scan of `sequentialSOSPUpdate`, so both backends
  return the same tree also from non-canonical input trees (ADR 0006); the documentation states
  the tie rule.
- A failed (poisoned) `sssp::result` now throws on every use, not only on `update()`; both
  backends report a parent cycle of an imported tree.
- Results also record the identity of the graph state, so a result used with another graph (or
  a reassigned graph variable) throws `stale_result_error` (ADR 0006).
- `resources` moves share the handle like copies; the log sink is called without the logging
  lock; host allocation failures leave the library as `out_of_memory_error`.
- The OpenMP performance A/B loads its regions from `parity/timed_regions/sssp.toml`, counts the
  moved first-touch cost, maps the original's `prepare` and end-to-end timers completely, and
  works under `flock(1)`; `build_reference.sh` keeps its logs and fingerprints each build.
- Tests run with `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE`; the lint workflow uses Doxygen 1.18.0, as
  `environment.yml` (now pinned) does.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- The PyPI name reservation: a pure-Python placeholder package `dyng` 0.0.1
  (`tools/name_reservation/`), published to PyPI and TestPyPI by `release.yml` through Trusted
  Publishing from tag `v0.0.1` (commit `15a6051`). It contains no library code.
