# Changelog

All notable changes to dynG are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) from 0.1.0.
Before 0.1.0 anything may change.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: Apache-2.0 license, NOTICE, CITATION.cff, AUTHORS, governance and
  contribution guides, ADRs 0001 (name), 0002 (license and credit), 0004 (naming) and 0014
  (approval checkpoints).
- Build system: CMake >= 3.30 with presets `dev`, `release`, `relwithdebinfo`, `cpu-only`,
  `asan`, `tsan` and `parity`; the `dyng-dev` conda environment (`environment.yml`) and
  `scripts/dev_env.sh`; install and export of `dyng::dyng` for `find_package(dyng)`.
- Core: error hierarchy with `DYNG_EXPECTS` / `DYNG_FAIL`; backends and `resources`
  (sequential, OpenMP with a thread count); `stream_ref`; `memory_resource_ref` and the host
  memory resource; `array_view`; `buffer`; host copies; logging with a replaceable sink; an
  instance-based profiler with `<algo>.<hook>` stage names; `citation()`.
- Quality: GoogleTest unit tests with CTest labels, the header self-containment check,
  `ci/check.sh`, the Doxygen check, pre-commit (clang-format, REUSE, codespell), and the
  `lint` and `cpu` GitHub workflows.
- Graph: `graph<V,E,W>` (pimpl, host storage, compact rows, objective-major weight columns,
  stored in-edges, version counter), `graph_view`, `csr` / `csr_view`, `edge_list` /
  `edge_list_view`, `edge_batch` / `edge_batch_view`, `apply_summary`, `graph_properties`
  with `row_order`, `multi_edges`, `batch_semantics` and the preset `mosp_compatible()`;
  `graph::apply` is MOSP's `applyChangeBatch()` ported straight (ADR 0010).
- I/O: Matrix Market reader and writer (seeded random weights bit-exact with `mospPrep
  mtx2csr`), the MOSP text CSR, `insert.txt` / `delete.txt` batches, distance and SSSP-tree
  files; strict parsing with `io_error` carrying path, line and column
  (`docs/api/file_formats.md`).
- Byte-parity fixtures for the updated CSR, its transposition and the weight-increase flags
  against MOSP-OpenMP@c352151 (`parity/fixtures/graph_io/`).
- `sssp`: `compute()` and `update()` on the sequential backend (MOSP's `sequentialSOSPUpdate`
  adapted into hooks) and the OpenMP backend (MOSP-OpenMP's `sospUpdateCpu` /
  `sospFromScratchCpu` ported straight); canonical trees identical across backends and
  byte-identical to MOSP-OpenMP@c352151 on the test corpus; `result::from_arrays` with
  canonicalization and `validate_inputs`; `stale_result_error` detection
  (`docs/algorithms/sssp.md`, ADR 0006).
- `update_stats`, and `dyng::update(res, g, batch, results...)` / `dyng::update_each()` to apply a
  batch once for several results.
- `dyng::testing` (installed target): `dijkstra()` with lowest-id ties and `check_sssp_tree()`.
- `tools/compat/dyng-compat-mosp` (drop-in clone of the per-objective part of MOSP's `mosp`
  driver and of `mospPrep init`), the `sssp_update` example, `parity/timed_regions/sssp.toml`
  and the sssp byte-parity fixtures (`parity/fixtures/sssp/`).
- A pure-Python name-reservation package `dyng` 0.0.1 (`tools/name_reservation/`) and the
  Trusted Publishing workflow `release.yml`.

### Changed

- The host transposition runs in parallel on the OpenMP backend (same, deterministic result).
