# Retrospective: M1a (walking skeleton, CPU `sssp`)

Status: **in progress.** Each implementation step appends its section; the final step adds the
milestone summary and the re-estimate of the roadmap.

## Step 1: repository bootstrap and M0 drafts (2026-09-27)

### Done

- Local repository `/home/sskg8/Projects/dyng` (branch `main`, no remote), local git identity,
  configuration files (`.clang-format`, `.clang-tidy`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`,
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.codespellrc`, `REUSE.toml`).
- `environment.yml` (conda env `dyng-dev`: Python 3.12, CMake 4.4, Ninja, clang-format and
  clang-tidy 22.1.8, Doxygen, pre-commit, reuse, pytest, numpy, build, twine) and
  `scripts/dev_env.sh`. The env was created on the development machine and the conda cache
  cleaned.
- CMake build (presets `dev`, `release`, `relwithdebinfo`, `cpu-only`, `asan`, `tsan`,
  `parity`), install/export (`find_package(dyng)` verified with a shared and a static build).
- Minimal core with unit tests (62 test cases; green on `dev`, `cpu-only`, `asan`, `tsan`, and
  with OpenMP off); the header self-containment check; the Doxygen check with warnings as
  errors.
- Community and legal drafts, ADRs 0001, 0002, 0004, 0014; the `dyng` 0.0.1 name-reservation
  package and `release.yml`; `ci/check.sh`, `lint.yml`, `cpu.yml`, `dependabot.yml`.

### Deviations from the plan (pragmatic choices, same intent)

| Plan | What was done | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `LICENSE` at the root | also `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt` | `reuse lint` requires the license text under `LICENSES/`; the root copy stays for GitHub and humans |
| `docs/Doxyfile.in` (configured by CMake) | `docs/Doxyfile`, driven by `ci/docs.sh` through environment variables | there is no `docs` CMake target before M5; the check is useful now |
| one `dyng_tests` executable | one GoogleTest executable per module (`dyng_core_tests`, ...) via `dyng_add_test()` | keeps rebuilds small and labels per module; CTest sees the same test cases |
| `DYNG_ENABLE_CUDA` ON if a CUDA compiler is found | OFF by default; ON fails at configure time with a clear message | the CUDA backend arrives in M1b; the option exists so presets and scripts keep their shape |
| `dyng::log()` | `dyng::log_message()` | an unqualified `log()` inside `namespace dyng` would hide the math function (ADR 0004) |
| `version_info{major, minor, patch}` | `major_version`, `minor_version`, `patch_version` | glibc may define macros `major` / `minor` (ADR 0004) |
| `resources::device()` "device 0" | -1 for host backends | a host backend has no device; documented |
| `cmake/CPM.cmake` | a small bootstrap that downloads the pinned CPM release with a SHA-256 check | the plan forbids vendoring third-party code |
| `VERSION` | `0.1.0.dev0` (PEP 440); CMake uses the numeric `0.1.0` | the next release is 0.1.0; the name-reservation package has its own version 0.0.1 |
| gersemi (CMake formatter) in pre-commit | not yet | not required by M1a ("a minimal pre-commit"); add with the M4 infrastructure |
| `dyng::testing` target | not yet created; `install.cmake` exports it once it exists | created with the first oracle (`testing::dijkstra`) in the `sssp` step |

### Notes for the next steps

- Add library code as a module with `dyng_add_module(NAME <module> SOURCES ...)` in
  `cpp/CMakeLists.txt`; tests with `dyng_add_test(NAME ... SOURCES ... LABELS cpu <module>)`.
- Stage timing: `dyng::scoped_stage stage(res, "sssp.loop");` (validated `<algo>.<hook>` names;
  CSV output is compatible with the MOSP `--timing` CSV).
- Preconditions: `DYNG_EXPECTS(cond, "message ", value, ...)` (at least one message argument).
- `ci/check.sh` is the gate; `DYNG_CHECK_SKIP="precommit"` skips steps that need the network.
- The `parity` preset sets `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=-O3` (MOSP-OpenMP's Makefile uses
  `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O3 -fopenmp`).

### Open items for the author

- Confirm who made the placeholder-identity commits in ESCHER-GPU, LabelPropagation-CUDA and
  MOSP-CUDA (credit in `AUTHORS.md`).
- Confirm funding acknowledgements, if any grant requires one (README "Acknowledgements").
- The ESCHER IPDPS 2026 title differs between the thesis publication list ("ESCHER: An
  Efficient and Scalable GPU Data Structure for Dynamic Hypergraph Triad Counting", used here)
  and the reference list of the TruCy manuscript ("ESCHER: Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph
  Evolution Representation with Application to Triad Counting", with S. Bhowmick as co-author);
  confirm the published title and author list.
- The TruCy/DynTruCy IEEE TC paper is recorded as submitted (2026); update when accepted.

### Process note

- Commit `dc56e9f` ("test: skip the impossible-allocation test under sanitizers") also contains
  `.github/dependabot.yml`, the `name-reservation` job of `lint.yml` and the first version of
  this retrospective, because they were staged together by mistake. History is not rewritten;
  this note records it.
